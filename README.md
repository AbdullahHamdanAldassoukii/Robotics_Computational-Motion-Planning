# Robotics: Computational Motion Planning

This repository contains notes and assignment for the University of Pennsylvania/Coursera in the Robotics Specialization: Computational Motion Planning. If you are student in this course, please do not plagiarize this work as it violates the Honor Code. — Edit

I am still taking the course. Therefore, I just have the first assignment:

 * Assignment 1 : Implement Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm.

If you have any doubts about the code, just contact me.
This is [on GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-motion-planning) so let me know if I've b0rked it somewhere.
