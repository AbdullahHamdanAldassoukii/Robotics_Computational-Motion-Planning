# Robotics: Computational Motion Planning

This repository contains notes and assignment for the University of Pennsylvania/Coursera in the Robotics Specialization: Computational Motion Planning. If you are student in this course, please do not plagiarize this work as it violates the Honor Code.

I am still taking the course. Therefore, I just have the first assignment:

 * Assignment 1 : Implement Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm.
